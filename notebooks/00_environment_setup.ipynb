    "This notebook contains instructions on how to create a local conda development environment as well as a Jupyter kernel based on this local conda environment. The conda development environment can be used for IDE-based development with the Azure Machine Learning (AML) Compute Instance (CI), e.g. with VSCode. The Jupyter kernel can be used for development on the AML CI using JupyterLab, Jupyter or AML notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will also show how to create AML environments for development (1), training (2) and deployment (3) respectively. These AML environments are environments that are registered to the AML workspace and can be shared by Data Scientists across different compute targets. This will ensure easy reproducability of environments. It is recommended to create separate environments for development (1), and training (2) and deployment (3) because not all dependencies will be needed in every stage of the ML lifecycle and the less dependencies we have, the less error-prone the environment is (e.g. visualization libraries might only be necessary during the development phase and metric tracking libraries might only be necessary during the training phase; also we want to have the deployment environment as lightweight as possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This notebook should be run from the azureml_py38 Jupyter kernel in the AML CI (it is available by default) or from any other Jupyter kernel that has the azureml.core library installed so that the new environments can be registered to the AML workspace using the AML Python SDK. Subsequent notebooks should then be run from the newly created Jupyter kernel (that is based on your local conda development environment) and therefore contain all packages needed for development."
